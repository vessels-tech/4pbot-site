The 4Ps

- 4Ps (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program) or Bridging Program for the Filipino Family is a CCT program by the ___
- It supports over 4 million clients, across __ provinces

The Challenge:

- Low income people often find it difficult to navigate Government systems (ref:)
- Many (how many?) 4Ps clients miss out on payments because they don't attend important sessions, or fufill other criteria
- When something goes wrong with payments, it can sometimes take months to resolve these issues
- 4Ps clients are taking payday loans and ...
- Getting cach to this many people across so many provinces is really hard!


Our ideas:

We're actively researching the 4Ps program, and looking opportunities where we can leverage mobile technology and AI to help improve the 4Ps program for its clients.

- Build a knowledge base where clients can easily ask questions and receive answers...
- Make a tool for automatically reminding households of important family development sessions, health clinic visits ... so that nobody misses out on payments.
- Use AI and chatbots to make filing a grievance and resolving the issues much simpler
